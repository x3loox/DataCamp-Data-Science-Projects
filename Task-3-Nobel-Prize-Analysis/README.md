# 🏆 Nobel Prize Data Analysis  

This project is part of my **Data Science journey** on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). 

The **Nobel Prize** is one of the most prestigious international awards, presented annually since **1901** across categories such as **Chemistry, Literature, Physics, Medicine, Economics, and Peace**.

## 📌 Project Description  
In this project, I analyzed the **Nobel Prize laureates dataset (1901–2023)** to uncover patterns and answer key questions using **Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  

---

## 🔍 Research Questions  
The analysis answers the following:  

1. 🧑‍🔬 **Most commonly awarded gender and birth country**  
   - Variables: `top_gender`, `top_country`  
2. 🇺🇸 **Decade with the highest ratio of US-born winners**  
   - Variable: `max_decade_usa`  
3. 👩‍🎓 **Decade & category with the highest proportion of female laureates**  
   - Variable: `max_female_dict`  
4. 👩‍🔬 **First woman to win a Nobel Prize & her category**  
   - Variables: `first_woman_name`, `first_woman_category`  
5. 🏅 **Repeat winners (individuals or organizations with multiple Nobel Prizes)**  
   - Variable: `repeat_list`
